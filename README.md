# ControlFreak
ControlFreak is a script I made with python to automate the process of compiling java in the command line because I can't stand how bloated IDE's are.

That said, it only works with a specific file structure:
```bash
PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME/
├───lib
|     (all of your .jars)
├───src
|     (expected output folder)
└───bin
      (the .java source code)
```
Just drop this script into PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME and then run it, easy peasy.

So much easier than wondering why eclipse or netbeans is throwing you some fucky error.
